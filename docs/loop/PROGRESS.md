stage: R&D-RAILS REPAIR — BUILT + REVIEWED, GATE-2 HOLD (operator decision required; NOT merged). Branch claude/rails-repair c878b685, draft PR #44. kronos-reviewer (Haiku) PASS R1-R8; but two findings, both confirmed by orchestrator Gate-2: F1 HIGH — brief-scope.sh:68 gh-api method filter only detects -X/--method, defaults GET, so `gh api .../pulls/* -f ...` (gh POSTs on -f/-F/--input) and glued -XPOST slip past; the generalized allow (pulls/* *, issues/* *) widened this from one PR to any PR/issue = write bypass of the ask tier (regression introduced by this repair). F2 MEDIUM — RAILS.md:79 still lists the narrowed allow as pulls/13/issues/2, contradicting the shipped wildcards. Recommend remediation before merge: (A) remove pulls/* *, pulls/*/reviews *, issues/* * from settings.json allow so they fall to the ask tier (removes fail-open; honors "no hardcoded PR/issue" better than wildcarding); (B) fix brief-scope.sh to classify -f/-F/--field/--raw-field/--input and glued -XPOST as non-GET -> deny; (C) correct RAILS.md prose. S8 §6 live-run still PAUSED (SEQ 140). Do NOT merge rails PR, do NOT reset local main, do NOT touch 3c712d4.

  RESOLVED — builder (Sonnet 5.5) pushed c878b685 (9 files, 544 ins), draft PR #44 opened; reviewer
  (Haiku) returned PASS R1-R8 with F1 HIGH + F2 MEDIUM; orchestrator Gate-2 confirmed both. Build and
  review complete; merge HELD pending operator decision on remediation A/B/C.

  A+B+C PUSHED as 9ed5b9c on claude/rails-repair (4 files: settings.json -3 removed the three PR/issue
  write allows; brief-scope.sh +132 hardened method filter, fail-closed; RAILS.md corrected;
  tests/test_brief_scope_hook.py new, 27 passed = 22 deny / 5 allow). BUT full suite = 1 failed, 3992
  passed, 1 skipped: tests/test_commit_authority.py::test_B31_Q_scope_audit. The seal-tax scope audit
  asserts names(329194c..HEAD) <= B36_SECTION_10; the rails-repair legitimately adds .claude/*, scripts/,
  .gitignore which are outside B36_SECTION_10. Pre-existing seal-tax design (fails on clean c878b685 too),
  NOT an A/B/C regression. A/B/C themselves verified sound.
seq254_pending_action_outcome: "RESOLVED — operator authorized adding tests/test_commit_authority.py to the rails-repair allowlist for scope-seal changes only (2026-11-04)."

  action: "Sonnet 5.5 applies minimal seal fix to tests/test_commit_authority.py only: seal B36 window names(329194c..445dbfc) <= B36_SECTION_10; add RAILS_SECTION_10 = exact rails window (the 10 rails files + tests/test_commit_authority.py); assert names(445dbfc..HEAD) <= RAILS_SECTION_10. Do NOT broaden B36_SECTION_10 or change rails behavior. Then Haiku re-review, Opus full-suite + semantic. PR #44 draft; no merge/mirror/3c712d4."
